- **Step 1**: Generate research hypotheses using structured prompts
- **Step 2**: Evaluate and rank ideas systematically
- **Step 3**: Design feasibility studies
- **CRAFT Framework**: Learn better prompting techniques
- **Resources Section**: Self-study materials for advanced techniques

## 📊 Practice Datasets

All datasets are **synthetic/simulated** but scientifically realistic, created specifically for educational purposes:

| Dataset | Description | Use Cases | Access |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **Fermentation Study** | Oat milk fermentation with probiotics over 48 hours | Time series analysis, treatment comparisons | [Download CSV](https://michael-borck.github.io/food-science-ai-workshop/datasets/fermentation-dataset.csv) |
| **Shelf Life Analysis** | Plant-based yogurt quality over 28 days | Degradation modeling, storage conditions | [Download CSV](https://michael-borck.github.io/food-science-ai-workshop/datasets/shelf-life-dataset.csv) |
| **Sensory Panel** | Consumer preferences for plant-based cheeses | Statistical analysis, demographic trends | [Download CSV](https://michael-borck.github.io/food-science-ai-workshop/datasets/sensory-panel-dataset.csv) |
| **Process Optimization** | Protein extraction parameter optimization | Response surface methodology, DOE | [Download CSV](https://michael-borck.github.io/food-science-ai-workshop/datasets/process-optimization-dataset.csv) |

### 🔬 Why Synthetic Data?
- **Educational focus**: Clear patterns for learning without real-world noise
- **No ethical concerns**: No confidential or proprietary information
- **Safe practice**: Students can experiment without affecting real research
- **Scalable**: Easy to modify or extend for different learning objectives

## 📖 Workshop Sessions

**Focus**: Foundations and structured approaches to AI-assisted research

**Key Topics**:
- Why structure beats "magic" prompting
- The 10-step research methodology
- Understanding AI limitations and capabilities
- Introduction to the CRAFT framework

**Outcomes**: Students understand how to manage AI tools effectively rather than being overwhelmed by them.

### Session 2: Hands-on Practice & Tools (50 minutes)
**Focus**: Practical application and skill building

**Key Topics**:
- Live data analysis demonstration

## 🎯 The CRAFT Framework

**C**ontext + **R**ole + **A**ction + **F**ormat + **T**one = Better AI Results

### Example Transformation:
❌ **Weak**: "What are some food science research ideas?"

✅ **CRAFT**: "You are an experienced food science researcher specializing in plant-based alternatives. Generate 5 innovative research hypotheses for Masters-level studies on oat milk fermentation. Present each with a title, keywords, and 150-word abstract. Focus on practical applications for the food industry."

## 🤖 AI Tools Compatibility

These materials work with any AI assistant:
- ✅ Microsoft Copilot
- ✅ ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- ✅ Claude (Anthropic)
- ✅ Google Gemini
- ✅ Other large language models

**Key principle**: Focus on prompting techniques and workflows, not specific tools.

## 👩‍🏫 For Instructors

### Customization Guidelines
- **Field-specific adaptation**: Replace food science examples with your domain
- **Dataset modification**: Use the synthetic data structure with your field's variables
- **Assessment adjustment**: Modify quiz questions for your student population
- **Timeline flexibility**: Sessions can be adapted from 50 minutes to 2+ hours

### Implementation Tips
1. **Start with assessment**: Use the readiness quiz to understand your class
2. **Practice first**: Try the tools yourself before class
3. **Emphasize verification**: Always stress the importance of validating AI outputs
4. **Encourage experimentation**: Students learn best through hands-on practice

## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### Data
- All datasets are **synthetic/simulated** for educational use only
- While scientifically plausible, they should not be cited as research results
- Real research should use actual experimental data

### AI Limitations
- **Always verify outputs**: AI can hallucinate facts, citations, and data
- **Understand limitations**: Knowledge cutoffs, training biases, lack of real-time data
- **Academic integrity**: Properly cite AI assistance in academic work
- **Human expertise essential**: AI assists human judgment, doesn't replace it
